# Katelyn-Bio-Readme

Hello, my name is Katelyn. Iâ€™m an organized, diligent high school student, a Yale Entrepreneurial Society AI/ML fellow, an AP Computer Science Principles student, and a current TKH KKCF fellow. I am able to code in JavaScript, Python, and HTML and I also have experience with UX design tools such as Figma. By using Github, I want to learn more about software development, including branching and merging. I hope it will assist me in creating my company, Tigerlily, a wellness tracker with to-do, budgeting, fitness, and journaling features.
